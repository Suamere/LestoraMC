# LestoraRPG

LestoraRPG will eventually add a bunch of small features that make Minecraft more hardcore or realistic.  Not graphically, but functionally.  For example, more likelihood for blocks to collapse when you are mining, better trading, and some utilities.

**Swimming complexity:  If you get in over your head, metaphorically speaking, you're going to feel quite the trauma (mentally and physically).  Until you learn to swim.**
**Body Temp: If you're too hot or cold, you will take damage.  To see your temperature, for now, run the showDebug command.  Definitely don't hold a bucket full of lava, for now.**

Current Development 1: Lighting Help.  Using my current highlighting capabilities, if you shift and there are torches nearby, the ground should highlight light orange on the edge (0 ground light), and light blue at the furthest location you should place a torch to ensure 1 light between two torches?
Current Development 2: Learning to swim.  Time in water, Time in game, Particular potions (water breathing), turtle helmet, etc.  As vanilla as possible.  Until then... use a boat!

## Features
- **Configuration:** Added lestora-common.toml, currently for configuring dynamic lighting.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Added some dynamic lighting, because apparently there's no good Forge mod that works on 1.21+.
- **Client-Side Only (Currently):** Works locally without affecting multiplayer sessions.
- **Highlight Blocks:** Highlights solid blocks within a specified radius sphere.  This is a personal test tool I used to get the mod published with some functionality.  I use it to "dig a crater".  It doesn't actually do anything, but it highlights where you should dig to keep a spherical hole.  Use Zero to disable.
- **Wetness:** In the near future, one form of complexity will be swimming and temperature.  At the moment, you can view the debug info with the showDebug command.  This will tell you the current level of wetness, and your supporting block.  It currently shows you instantly dry out of water, but I'll have dampness persist longer soon.

## Manual Installation
1. Download the mod JAR from CurseForge.
2. Place the JAR file into your `mods` folder.
3. Launch Minecraft with the Forge profile.

## Commands
- Use the command `/lestora setLevels swimLevel <0-3>` to set your swimLevel.  Defaults to 0, which means you essentially insta-die in water that's two deep (punny).  Level 3 means you can swim.
- Use the command `/lestora highlightRadius <radius>` to highlight a spherical area of breakable blocks from your current location.
- Use the command `/lestora showDebug [true/false]` to show current debug info related to beta development.
- Use the command `/lestora dynamicLighting [true/false]` to enable or disable dynamic lighting in this mod. (Defaults to true)
- Use the command `/lestora whatAmIHolding` to print out the official name of the item you're holding.  Currently used to help populate the config file for dynamic lighting.

## Compatibility
- **Minecraft Version:** 1.21.4
- **Forge Version:** 54.1.0

## Troubleshooting
If you run into issues (e.g., crashes or unexpected behavior), check the logs in your `crash-reports` or `logs` folder. You can also open an issue on the mod’s GitHub repository.
