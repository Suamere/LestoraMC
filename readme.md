# LestoraRPG

LestoraRPG will eventually add a bunch of small features that make Minecraft more hardcore or realistic.  Not graphically, but functionally.  For example, more likelihood for blocks to collapse when you are mining, better trading, and some utilities.

Current Development: Swimming complexity.  If you get in over your head, metaphorically speaking, you're going to feel quite the trauma (mentally and physically).  Until you learn to swim.

Next Development: Learning to swim.  Time in water, Time in game, Particular potions (water breathing), turtle helmet, etc.  As vanilla as possible.  Until then... use a boat!

Upcoming Development: Wetness == Coldness... especially in cold biomes.

## Features
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Temporarily added some dynamic lighting, because apparently there's no good Forge mod that works on 1.21.3+
- **Client-Side Only (Currently):** Works locally without affecting multiplayer sessions.
- **Highlight Blocks:** Highlights solid blocks within a specified radius sphere.  This is a personal test tool I used to get the mod published with some functionality.  I use it to "dig a crater".  It doesn't actually do anything, but it highlights where you should dig to keep a spherical hole.  Use Zero to disable.
- **Wetness:** In the near future, one form of complexity will be swimming and temperature.  At the moment, you can view the debug info with the showDebug command.  This will tell you the current level of wetness, and your supporting block.  It currently shows you instantly dry out of water, but I'll have dampness persist longer soon.

## Manual Installation
1. Download the mod JAR from CurseForge.
2. Place the JAR file into your `mods` folder.
3. Launch Minecraft with the Forge profile.

## Commands
- Use the command `/lestora highlightRadius <radius>` to highlight a spherical area of breakable blocks from your current location.
- Use the command `/lestora showDebug [true/false]` to show current debug info related to beta development.
